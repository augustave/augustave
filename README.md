AI Interfaces + Developer Tools

I build inspection-first product experiences: agentic workflows, verification UX, and design governance systems.
My work focuses on making powerful AI feel trustworthy through clear progress, permissions, failure handling, and reproducible artifacts.

## What I build (in one sentence)
Interfaces that make powerful systems feel **trustworthy**: clear progress, explicit permissions, deterministic replays, and failure containment—plus design systems that prevent generative drift.

  <summary><strong>3-min skim</strong> — the artifacts (what to click)</summary>

### Artifact Index (projects you can inspect)
- **LOGIKK** — *State cockpit for complex workflows.* Replayable sequences, auditability, fault containment.
- **DECAGON** — *Design governance engine.* Constraints that prevent aesthetic drift in automated pipelines.
- **NEBRASKA** — *Agent coordination protocol.* Playbook-style “huddle calls” for multi-agent teams.
- **MINDGRAPHSIM** — *Research/simulation tool.* Cognitive systems modeled as measurable dynamics.
- **VAKNAN-A2** — *Ambient computing system design.* Orchestration loops built around trust + restraint.
- **ANOTE** — *Reasoning interface design.* Explicit uncertainty, candidate comparison, repeatable decisions.

Pinned repos below are organized by: **trust UX → governance → agent workflows → simulation**.

  <summary><strong>8-min case</strong> — my design thesis (how I think)</summary>

## Thesis: Inspection beats persuasion
As systems become more autonomous, “trust” becomes an interface problem.  
So I design around:
- **Progress you can understand** (what it’s doing, why, and what’s next)
- **Permissions that are timely** (safe actions, explicit boundaries, reversible steps)
- **Failure that doesn’t cascade** (containment, recovery, graceful degradation)
- **Reproducibility as credibility** (replayable scripts, state hashes, verification protocols)

### The Verification Suite (portable across projects)
- **View Decoupling:** switch views without corrupting state (Graph ↔ Timeline).
- **Replay Determinism:** replay the same event script → identical state hash + identical marks.
- **Fault Containment:** trigger a module/UI failure → cockpit remains operational.

If you’re reviewing for roles in agentic UX, devtools, or platform tooling: this is the spine.

## Design focus (the problems I like)
- Agentic workflows: **progress, permissions, logs, retries, cancellation, recovery**
- Developer-facing UX: **dense information that stays readable**
- Governance systems: **constraints + verification instead of “style vibes”**
- Simulation + research prototypes that stay grounded in **testable artifacts**

---

## Stack (what I actually ship with)
- **Frontend:** TypeScript, React, UI systems, interaction architecture, state modeling
- **Prototyping:** fast product prototypes, instrumentable flows, docs that read like specs
- **Systems patterns:** event-driven thinking, deterministic workflows, verification-first UX
- **Research tooling:** simulation prototypes and structured experimentation

---

## What I’m looking for
Teams working on frontier AI product design:
- Agentic UX and “what the system is doing” transparency
- Platform & tools (internal tooling, devtools, reliability UX)
- Growth + onboarding for complex systems (activation without confusion)

---

## Notes on collaboration
I like small teams, tight feedback loops, and artifacts that survive scrutiny:
specs, diagrams, verification scripts, and interfaces that explain themselves.
