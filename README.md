AI Interfaces + Developer Tools

I build inspection-first product experiences: agentic workflows, verification UX, and design governance systems.
My work focuses on making powerful AI feel trustworthy through clear progress, permissions, failure handling, and reproducible artifacts.

  <summary><strong>3-min skim</strong> (what I build + why it matters)</summary>

### Artifact Index (real projects you can inspect)
- **LOGIKK** — UI/state cockpit for deterministic workflows (replayable sequences, fault containment).
- **DECAGON** — design governance engine: rules that prevent brand drift in automated pipelines.
- **NEBRASKA** — agent coordination framework using playbook-style “huddle calls” for multi-agent teams.
- **MEMENTO / CHRONSYNC** — React/TypeScript apps demonstrating UI craft, performance, and interaction systems.
- **MINDGRAPHSIM** — cognitive simulation prototype: ideas as objects with material properties + measurable patterns.
- **GYRO (Prompts)** — a prompt “cognitive stack” for structured reasoning: fold → prune → optimize → reroute → synthesize.

Pinned repos below are organized to match how a hiring manager scans: narrative → proof → depth.

  <summary><strong>8-min case</strong> (how I design for trust in agentic systems)</summary>

## My design thesis: Inspection beats persuasion
When systems get more autonomous, “trust” becomes an interface problem.
So I design products that:
- Show progress without noise
- Ask for permissions at the right moment (and explain why)
- Fail gracefully (containment > cascade)
- Stay auditable (replayable scripts + state hashes)

### The Verification Suite (portable across projects)
- **View Decoupling:** switch views (Graph ↔ Timeline) without changing state.
- **Replay Determinism:** replay the same event script → identical state hash + identical timeline marks.
- **Fault Containment:** trigger a failure → cockpit remains operational.

### What I’m optimizing for
- Clarity under ambiguity
- Keyboard-first speed where it matters
- Information density that remains readable
- Reproducibility as credibility

## What I’m looking for
Product Design roles at the frontier of AI:
- Chat / agentic UX
- Platform & tools (B2B, developer-facing)
- Growth + onboarding for complex systems
- Prototyping-heavy teams that ship fast

---

## Core Stack (what I actually build with)
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Motion/Framer Motion, component systems (shadcn/ui / Radix patterns)
- **State + UI Systems:** Zustand patterns, interaction architecture, verification-style UI
- **Backend (varies by project):** Firebase / Supabase patterns, edge functions, auth + storage
- **Prototyping + Research:** Python for simulations, prompting systems, and structured experiments

## Start Here (pinned)
If you only click one repo: **START-HERE / brain-is-the-product**
It maps the artifacts, provides run steps, and links to verification proofs.
